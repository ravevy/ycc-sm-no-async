# Young Coders Club State Management without Async Case

There will be a playlist which contains titles and durations. Each title will have own button.
When i click the button i will see its own details like title and duration. 
You can use redux and redux-toolkit.
At first, UI not important only it should be work.
Playlist details should be in store.
Typescript is bonus.
